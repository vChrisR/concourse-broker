// A Step is an object that can be executed, whose result (e.g. Success) can be
// collected, and whose dependent resources (e.g. Containers, Volumes) can be
// released, allowing them to expire.
type Step interface {
	// Run is called when it's time to execute the step. It should indicate when
	// it's ready, and listen for signals at points where the potential time is
	// unbounded (i.e. running a task or a resource action).
	//
	// Steps wrapping other steps should be careful to propagate signals and
	// indicate that they're ready as soon as their wrapped steps are ready.
	//
	// Steps should return ErrInterrupted if they received a signal that caused
	// them to stop.
	//
	// Steps must be idempotent. Each step is responsible for handling its own
	// idempotency; usually this is done by saving off "checkpoints" in some way
	// that can be checked again if the step starts running again from the start.
	// For example, by having the ID for a container be deterministic and unique
	// for each step, and checking for properties on the container to determine
	// how far the step got.

	// executed in the build plan. Steps with containers should release their
	// containers with infinite ttl

	// Container reaper also checks for unsuccessful (failed, aborted, errored) builds
	// that are not the latest builds of a job, and release their containers in 5 minutes

	// return false.
